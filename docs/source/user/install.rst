Installation
============

AtomDB can be installed with ``pip``. In a virtual environment, simply run the
following command to install AtomDB and its dependencies:

.. code:: bash

   pip install .


If you intend to build the `Sphinx documentation`__, you can also install AtomDB
with the optional dependencies required to do so by appending the ``[doc]`` tag
to the install target:

.. _Sphinx: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/

__ Sphinx_

.. code:: bash

   pip install .[doc]
